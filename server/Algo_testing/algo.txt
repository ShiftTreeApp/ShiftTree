Variables:
Employee names = [array of employee names]
EmployeeShiftsNeed = [name: array of shiftsneeded]-eg if 60 shifts and 9 employees, everyone will work 9 shifts, and 4 left over. leftover shifts assigned at random
Shifts = [Array of arrays]: should be constructed from shift info in database as follows.
    for each shift in shifts, add the array of employees signed up as an array of arrays. This third array has [name, weight]
TODO: AVOID Scheduling shifts next to each other?
TODO: 
Iterate through and find shifts with no signups. Add to Array: Unwanted
Iterate through shifts and look for all arrays of length 1. Add shift to set schedule. Decrement that employees shiftsneeded
    -if only person who can work is full on shifts somehow, Add to Array: Unwanted
Iterate through shifts and look for shift with 2 signups
    -assign shift to user with highest weighting. If weighting the same, to employee with most shifts(or random)
Continue till shifts done. 
Enter Unwanted Array:
    -iterate through and assign to remaining employees
